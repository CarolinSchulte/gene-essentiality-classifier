# gene-essentiality-classifier

Implementation of logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence for prokaryotic genes whether they are essential or not. Gene essentiality data are from the [Online Gene Essentiality (OGEE)](https://v3.ogee.info/#/home) database. The best performing model (MLP) achieves an AUC score of 0.8 on a held-out test dataset.
