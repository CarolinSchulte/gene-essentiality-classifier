# gene-essentiality-classifier

Implementation of logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and a multi-layer perceptron to predict based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence for prokaryotic genes whether they are essential or not. Gene essentiality data are from the [Online Gene Essentiality (OGEE)](https://v3.ogee.info/#/home) database.
